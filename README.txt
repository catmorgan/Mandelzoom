This program displays the Mandelbrot set. You can zoom in on a specific region
by dragging the mouse to create a square around an area. This pushes the display onto the stack. You can then right click and zoom in (push) or zoom out (pop) from the areas that you have already seen.

There is a current bug where if you try to push/pop when there is no next/previous item, the program crashes.
